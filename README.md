This is the main file for the Rousis Matrix IoT project. 
The project is based on ESP32 and is used to display messages on a 16x96 LED matrix. 
The messages are received from a server and are displayed on the LED matrix Display. 
The project also includes a DS18B20 temperature sensor and a buzzer. 
The buzzer is used to indicate that the temperature is above a certain threshold. 
The project also includes a web server that allows the user to change the WiFi credentials. 
The project is based on the RousisMatrix16 library, which is a library for controlling the LED matrix.
